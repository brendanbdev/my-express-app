9-11-24: For now, lets only make it possible to edit entries with unique IDs. This may make the script 
tightly coupled with the database. Maybe it will be worth it, maybe it won't. 

Also just know that keys can be strings:
const obj = {
    name: "Alice",          // key is a string
    "age": 30,              // key is a string (with quotes)
};
console.log(obj.name);      // "Alice"
console.log(obj["age"]);    // 30
